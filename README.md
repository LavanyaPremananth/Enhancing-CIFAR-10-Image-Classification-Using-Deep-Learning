# Enhancing-CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning

Welcome to the "Enhancing CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using Deep Learning" project repository. This project explores various techniques to improve image classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset through deep learning methodologies.

# Introduction
In the field of computer vision, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks like image classification. The CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, serves as a standard benchmark for evaluating deep learning models in image recognition tasks.

The primary objectives of this project include:

1. Developing a baseline deep learning model for CIFAR-10 image classification.
2. Experimenting with different model tuning techniques (e.g., adjusting model capacity, regularization, dropout) to enhance classification accuracy.
3. Evaluating the effectiveness of these techniques and discussing computational requirements and scalability.
4. Analyzing ethical and social implications associated with using deep learning models for image classification.
